## 1. Views


### 1.1. Features:

1. View is a database object
2. View is created over an SQL query.
3. View doesn't store any table.
4. It is a representative of underlying query.
5. View is like a virtual table.
6. View can't improve query performance.


### 1.2. Use cases:

Suppose, you are working on a database project and the project supervisor asked you to show clients the improvement of project work. 

He said, "Make a way to show them something about the project."


Me, "Should I show them the whole thing?"


PS,"No. Absolutely not. Because there are some confidential information about customers."



Me, "Your suggestion in this regard?"



***PS, "Create some views. Clients will run those views using select statement and able to see the selective queries."




Me, "OK. On it."





PS, "It is the representative of underlying queries. In that case, if the clients want to have a look at the main database, they will not able to do that for restriction. So, instead of sharing whole SQL file. Do this thing. I hope this is the perfect solution."***
