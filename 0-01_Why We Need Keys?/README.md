# üí° Why We Need Keys in Table?


Suppose, there is a table named `Employees`. In the `Employees` table, there are the columns named:


- Employee ID
- Employee Name
- Social Security Number
- Salary
- Phone number
- Email number


Like this: 


| Employee_ID |      Name      |        SSN        |       Salary       |           Phone          |        Email       | 
| -----------|----------------|-------------------|--------------------|--------------------------|--------------------|
|  101       |      John     |        AA       |       50000       |           0111890     |        johnaa@abcd.com     | 
|  102       |      Alen     |        BB       |       52000       |           0113890     |        alenbb@abcd.com     |
|  103       |      John     |        CC       |       53000       |           0115890     |        johncc@abcd.com     |
|  104       |      Johnson     |        DD       |       55000       |           0151890     |        johnsondd@abcd.com     |
|  105       |      John     |        EE    |       56000       |           0111870     |        johnee@abcd.com     |
|  106       |      Charles  |        FF       |       60000       |           0141890     |        charlesff@abcd.com     |



‚ñ∂Ô∏è Execute the query by names
1. Suppose, we have generated a query to find the salary of "John" and increase his salary by 10%. We have found the salary of "John" and tried to execute the query. But is it right? No, because there are 3 **Johns** in this `Employees` table. 

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Execute the query by salary amounts



2.  Now, can we find the John's salary with the query of finding the salary amount? No, beacuse that same kind of amount can be matched with multiple people.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Execute the query by department names



3. If I want to execute the query following the department names. That can't be possible also. Because, there can be two **John's** in the same department. 

‚ñ∂Ô∏è So, What's the ultimate goal?



4. So, to find the specific outcome and remove the data inconsistency and most importantly **to uniquely identify the tuples**, we need the keys in Relational Databases.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Sample Query



5. So the query will be

```SQL
SELECT Salary+Salary*0.10
FROM Employees 
WHERE Employee_id = 101; 
```


OR 

Based on another similar table

```SQL
SELECT 
	  ed.EmployeeID,
      es.Salary,
      es.Salary+es.Salary*0.10 "Incremented Salary"
FROM EmployeeDemographics ed
JOIN EmployeeSalary es
     ON ed.EmployeeID = es.EmployeeID
WHERE ed.EmployeeID = 1001; 
```


Result:

1 row returned.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è In one word


To uniquely, identify the tuples or rows in a table, keys are important. 







# üí° More Breakdown

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è 01. Uniqueness

### üëá Important points to note


1. **What does key do?**:



Keys ensure that each record in the database table has a unique identifier.


2. **What will happen without keys?**: 


There will be no way to differentiate between records, leading to duplication or data redundancy and data inconsistency.


3. It is important for maintaining **data integrity** and avoiding **data inconsistency**.



4. **When joining two tables without keys, what will happen?**


- There will be duplication of data.
- It becomes challenging to maintain data integrity.
- Can create incorrect associations and multiple potential matches.

-Example: 

Let's consider a scenario where you have a "Customers" table and an "Orders" table in a database. Without keys, attempting to join these tables is like trying to match customers with their orders based on some general criteria such as name or address. However, this approach can lead to incorrect associations or multiple potential matches. For instance, if two customers have the same name, the join may mistakenly assign orders to the wrong customer or create duplicate entries.


- Customers (Customer_id,Customer_name, Age)
- Orders (Order_id, customer_id, Date)

- Let's make a demo table

```SQL
CREATE TABLE Customers
(Customer_id int,
Customer_name varchar(50),
Age int);
```


```SQL
-- Creating Orders Table
CREATE TABLE Orders 
(Customer_id int,
order_id int,
Order_Date date);
```



```SQL
-- Insert Into Customer Table
INSERT INTO Customers VALUES
(1001,"Shihab",30),
(1002,"John",43),
(1003,"Shahed",32),
(1003,"Shahed",32),
(1004,"Martin",23);
```



```SQL
-- Insert into Orders Table
INSERT INTO Orders VALUES
(1001,101,'2023-07-01'),
(1002,102,'2023-02-01'),
(1003,103,'2023-03-03'),
(1003,104,'2023-03-03'),
(1004,102,'2023-03-09');
```



```SQL
-- Joining two tables  without primary keys! 
SELECT
      c.customer_id "Customer ID",
      c.customer_name "Customer Name",
      o.order_id "Order ID"
FROM Customers c 
JOIN Orders o 
     ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id; 
```




Result: 

7 rows returned. 




| Customer ID | Customer Name | Order ID |
|-------------|---------------|----------|
| 1001        | Shihab        | 101      |
| 1002        | John          | 102      |
| 1003        | Shahed        | 103      |
| 1003        | Shahed        | 103      |
| 1003        | Shahed        | 104      |
| 1003        | Shahed        | 104      |
| 1004        | Martin        | 102      |



So, see there are duplicates and data reducndency due to not having primary keys or unique identifiers. 


### üëá Metaphor to understand:
Just like, each person has a unique fingerprint to identify. No duplicate fingerprint can't be found. Keys work like fingerprints.
